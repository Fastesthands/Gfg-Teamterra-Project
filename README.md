Project Title: NLP-Enabled Symptom Analyzer for Disease Prediction and Medication Recommendation
Project Description:
This project aims to develop a system that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to analyze symptoms reported by patients and predict their condition, followed by medication recommendation. The system also includes a machine learning-based early detection tool for hospital doctors and administrators, which predicts diseases like diabetes, liver disease, breast cancer, and kidney disease. Additionally, the system provides a helpline for emergency situations to access helpline numbers. The system incorporates a simple login-based interface for users to securely access the functionalities.

Methodology:
The following methodology will be followed in the development of the NLP-Enabled Symptom Analyzer system:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: A comprehensive dataset of symptom data and corresponding disease labels will be collected. The data will be preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information, and converted into a format suitable for NLP analysis and machine learning algorithms.

NLP Implementation: After the data preprocessing step, we use feature selection to identify the most frequently occurring words in each condition category using a word cloud. The features are then filtered and converted to lowercase. Next, we lemmatize the symptoms to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
We also filter out the top medicines available for the predicted condition. All of these steps are implemented using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) Library.

Machine Learning Model Development:After the data preprocessing step, we implemented a feature selection process using NLP techniques, where we selected the optimal features and visualized the data. Using a heatmap, we removed any unwanted features that could reduce the accuracy of the model.
We experimented with different algorithms on different sets of diseases. For example, we used classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and Ensemble Random Forest. Based on the accuracy scores, we selected the best model for our early stage disease prediction.
To evaluate the predictions, we used a confusion matrix, and our model was able to perform very well in the tests.

Early Detection Tool Development: A separate login-based interface will be developed for hospital doctors and administrators to input patient data and utilize the machine learning models for disease prediction. This will include a user-friendly interface for data input and a mechanism to download prediction results for further analysis and decision-making.

Helpline Feature Implementation: A helpline feature will be implemented to provide quick access to emergency helpline numbers in case of urgent medical situations. This will involve integrating helpline numbers into the system and providing a user-friendly interface for users to access helpline information easily.

Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is a functional NLP-Enabled Symptom Analyzer system that can accurately analyze symptoms reported by patients, predict their condition, and recommend appropriate medications. The system will also include an early detection tool for hospital doctors and administrators to predict diseases at an early stage and a helpline feature for emergency situations. The system will be user-friendly, scalable, and capable of improving disease detection accuracy, patient outcomes, and healthcare provider support.

Conclusion:
This project aims to utilize NLP and machine learning techniques to develop an advanced system for disease prediction and medication recommendation. The methodology will involve data collection and preprocessing, NLP implementation, machine learning model development, medication recommendation, early detection tool development, helpline feature implementation, and documentation and deployment. The expected outcome is a functional system that can contribute
